//! # wasm4games-wasm4pm — the admission bridge
//!
//! ## [BRIDGE STATUS]
//!
//! | Flag | Meaning |
//! |------|---------|
//! | **PINNING_REQUIRED** | Git deps in `Cargo.toml` are not pinned to exact commit hashes. Both `wasm4pm` (no rev) and `wasm4pm-compat` (tag only) are mutable references. Pin to `rev = "<hash>"` before any real use. |
//! | **STUBS_ACTIVE** | All `W4pm*Stub` types and `/* wasm4pm_compat::Type */` placeholders are offline stand-ins. The bridge will not produce real admission verdicts until these are replaced with confirmed upstream types. |
//! | **NOT_BUILT_BY_DEFAULT** | This crate is excluded from the workspace (`[workspace] exclude`). It is never compiled by `make build`, `make test`, or CI. Build explicitly: `cargo build -p wasm4games-wasm4pm` (requires network). |
//!
//! **IMPORTANT: This crate is EXCLUDED from the offline workspace. It requires network
//! access to fetch `wasm4pm` and `wasm4pm-compat` from their git repositories. It will
//! not build as part of the normal workspace commands (`make build`, `make test`, etc.).**
//!
//! This crate is the **online-only** bridge between the offline, dependency-free
//! [`wasm4games`] evidence types and the upstream **wasm4pm** process miner (via its stable
//! `wasm4pm-compat` surface). It maps candidate evidence emitted by wasm4games kernels onto
//! the canonical wasm4pm-compat types and submits it for admission.
//!
//! ## Doctrine
//!
//! > Engines project worlds; wasm4games operates patterns; **wasm4pm admits evidence.**
//!
//! wasm4games never decides admissibility; it emits candidate evidence. This crate carries
//! that evidence across the boundary to the authority.
//!
//! ## Pre-use checklist
//!
//! Before activating this bridge, complete these steps in order:
//!
//! 1. **Pin git revisions** — replace branch/tag references in `Cargo.toml` with exact
//!    `rev = "<commit-hash>"` values. Tags and branches are mutable; only commit hashes
//!    guarantee reproducible builds.
//! 2. **Reconcile stubs** — replace each `/* wasm4pm_compat::Type */` placeholder and each
//!    `W4pm*Stub` type with the confirmed upstream path from `wasm4pm-compat`. Delete the
//!    stub types once replaced.
//! 3. **Confirm every TODO** — search for `// TODO: confirm against wasm4pm-compat` and
//!    verify field names, variant sets, and builder APIs match the real types.
//! 4. **Build online** — `cargo build -p wasm4games-wasm4pm` (requires network access).
//! 5. **Test roundtrip** — `cargo test -p wasm4games-wasm4pm` to verify evidence conversion.
//!
//! ## Usage example (scaffold — compile-time only until wired)
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use wasm4games_wasm4pm::{Bridge, AdmissionOutcome};
//! use wasm4games::evidence::ocel::OcelLog;
//!
//! let bridge = Bridge::new(42);
//! let log = OcelLog::default();
//! match bridge.admit_log(&log) {
//!     AdmissionOutcome::Admitted     => println!("admitted"),
//!     AdmissionOutcome::Refused(code) => println!("refused: {code}"),
//!     AdmissionOutcome::Inconclusive  => println!("inconclusive"),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Status: scaffolding pinned against the canonical types
//!
//! The exact upstream API is not vendored here and is unavailable offline, so the mapping
//! functions below are written with **precise signatures** and `// TODO: confirm against
//! wasm4pm-compat <type>` notes against the canonical types:
//!
//! - `OcelLog` — an object-centric event log.
//! - `LinkedOcel` — events with materialized object linkage.
//! - `ReceiptEnvelope` / `ReceiptChain` — sealed, tamper-evident receipts.
//! - `ConformanceResult` — the admission verdict.
//! - `Evidence<T, State, W>` — the typestate evidence wrapper.
//!
//! Because the crate is workspace-**excluded**, it is not part of the offline build; it may
//! not compile until the upstream dependencies are resolved and the `TODO`s are reconciled
//! against the real types. The upstream type paths are written as the canonical
//! `wasm4pm_compat::*` names but kept commented (or behind a feature) so the intent is
//! unambiguous and the diff to "real" code is minimal once the API is confirmed.
//!
//! ## Before use
//!
//! 1. Pin the git revisions in `Cargo.toml` to exact commit hashes.
//! 2. Replace each `/* wasm4pm_compat::Type */` placeholder with the confirmed path.
//! 3. Reconcile every `// TODO: confirm against wasm4pm-compat ...` note.
