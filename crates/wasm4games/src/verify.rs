//! In-crate self-checks: an *offline* admissibility proxy.
//!
//! # What This Module Can and Cannot Verify
//!
//! **Can verify (offline):**
//! - Status codes are in-bounds for the known [`crate::class::status`] vocabulary.
//! - Replay frames produce a deterministic digest when folded twice with the same input.
//! - Negative fixtures carry the correct refusal status for their pattern.
//! - All items in [`crate::patterns::PATTERN_REGISTRY`] are internally self-consistent.
//!
//! **Cannot verify (requires `wasm4pm`):**
//! - Whether a real authority would admit or refuse a given event.
//! - Receipt chain integrity across process boundaries.
//! - Scope-level conformance rules from the `wasm4pm-compat` ontology.
//!
//! **This module is NOT the admission authority.** The external `wasm4pm` service
//! performs real admission/refusal (see [`crate::compat`]). Offline checks here give
//! fast, dependency-free confidence that the registry is self-consistent and that
//! individual pattern kernels behave deterministically, but they do not substitute for
//! a live `wasm4pm` conformance check.
